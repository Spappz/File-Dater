# File Dater
 Creates a log of files and their creation dates.

 This code outputs a tab-separated text file with a list of filenames (relative to `$startpath`) and the creation timestamp for each. Bear in mind the resulting file can get quite big.

## Settings
##### `$startPath` _array of strings_
Absolute paths to your desired start folder. 

##### `$output` _string_
Absolute path to the desired output text file.
